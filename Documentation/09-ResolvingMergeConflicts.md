# Resolving Merge Conflicts in Git

## Introduction

Merge conflicts are an inevitable challenge in collaborative development. They occur when Git is unable to automatically reconcile differences between two branches, especially when multiple developers modify the same lines of code. Understanding how to resolve merge conflicts efficiently is a crucial skill for any developer working in a team.

In this guide, we'll explore how merge conflicts happen, why they occur, and how to resolve them step-by-step.

## What is a Merge Conflict?

A **merge conflict** occurs when Git cannot automatically determine which changes to keep because two or more contributors have modified the same line(s) in a file. Git requires manual intervention to decide the final version.

### **Why Donâ€™t Merge Conflicts Happen in Solo Development?**

When you work alone, merge conflicts are rare because all commits originate from you. Conflicts arise in a team setting when multiple contributors modify the same section of a file, leading to ambiguity for Git.

## **Understanding Merge Conflicts in Action**

### **Step 1: Creating Two Branches**

Let's start by creating two branches to simulate a merge conflict.

```sh
# Create a new branch named 'dev-jsm'
git branch dev-jsm

# Create and switch to another branch 'dev-adrien'
git checkout -b dev-adrien
```

Now, we'll modify a file (`README.md`) in the `dev-adrien` branch.

### **Step 2: Modifying Code in `dev-adrien` Branch**

Edit the `README.md` file:

```md
# Welcome to Git

This is coming from dev-adrien.
```

Save the file, then commit the changes:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Modified README heading and added a new line"
git push -u origin dev-adrien
```

The branch now exists remotely, and we create a **pull request (PR)**.

### **Step 3: Making Conflicting Changes in `dev-jsm` Branch**

Switch to the `dev-jsm` branch:

```sh
git checkout dev-jsm
```

Modify `README.md` differently:

```md
# Heyo everyone, welcome to my Git guide!

Yo, Johnny here.
```

Commit and push the changes:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Updated README with a new heading and personal signature"
git push -u origin dev-jsm
```

Now, another **PR** is created from the `dev-jsm` branch.

### **Step 4: Merging One PR and Causing a Merge Conflict**

If the `dev-jsm` branch gets merged first, GitHub will show a **merge conflict** when trying to merge `dev-adrien` into `main`:

```sh
error: Merge conflict in README.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

## **How to Resolve Merge Conflicts in Git**

### **Step 1: Checkout to `main` and Pull Latest Changes**

Before resolving conflicts, synchronize your local `main` branch:

```sh
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

This ensures that your local repository is up-to-date with the latest changes.

### **Step 2: Switch to Your Branch and Merge `main`**

```sh
git checkout dev-adrien
git merge main
```

Git detects the conflict in `README.md` and marks the conflicting areas.

---

## **Step 3: Understanding Gitâ€™s Conflict Markers**

Opening `README.md` after a conflict will show Gitâ€™s conflict markers:

```md
<<<<<<< HEAD

# Welcome to Git

# This is coming from dev-adrien.

# Heyo everyone, welcome to my Git guide!

Yo, Johnny here.

> > > > > > > main
```

### **Step 4: Manually Resolving the Conflict**

Decide the final version by keeping essential parts from both contributions:

```md
# Welcome to Git

This is coming from dev-adrien.  
Yo, Johnny here.
```

Save the file and mark the conflict as resolved.

### **Step 5: Commit and Push the Resolved File**

```sh
git add README.md
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in README.md"
git push origin dev-adrien
```

Now, GitHub will allow the PR to be merged successfully.

## **Best Practices to Avoid Merge Conflicts**

- **Regularly pull from `main`** to keep your branch up-to-date.
- **Communicate with teammates** to prevent modifying the same files simultaneously.
- **Use feature branches** and limit changes per PR.
- **Write meaningful commit messages** to track changes efficiently.
- **Use Git rebase when appropriate** to apply changes in a cleaner way.

## **Conclusion**

Merge conflicts are a common occurrence in collaborative projects. Understanding how they arise and resolving them effectively will enhance your efficiency as a developer. By following the structured approach outlined in this guide, you can confidently tackle merge conflicts and ensure a smoother workflow.

With practice, resolving merge conflicts will become second nature! ðŸš€
