## Git Installation & Setup

To get started with Git, you need to install it on your system. Whether you're on **Windows, Mac, or Linux**, installing Git is just a few clicks away.

### Installing Git

1. **Download Git**

   - Open your browser and search for **Download Git**.
   - Visit the official Git website and download the version for your operating system.
   - Follow the installation steps to complete the setup.

2. **Verify Installation**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to check if Git is installed:
     ```sh
     git --version
     ```
   - If installed correctly, this will return the Git version number.

### Configuring Git

After installing Git, you need to configure your username and email. This helps Git track who makes changes in the project.

1. **Set your Git username**

   ```sh
   git config --global user.name 'Your Name'
   ```

   Example:

   ```sh
   git config --global user.name 'John Doe'
   ```

2. **Set your Git email**

   ```sh
   git config --global user.email 'your.email@example.com'
   ```

   Example:

   ```sh
   git config --global user.email 'johndoe@example.com'
   ```

3. **Verify your Git configuration**
   ```sh
   git config --global --list
   ```
   This will display your username and email settings to confirm they were set correctly.

### Using Git in an IDE

Many modern **IDEs (Integrated Development Environments)** have built-in Git support. The video recommends **WebStorm** because of its seamless Git integration, allowing you to:

- **Create branches**
- **Commit changes**
- **Pull and merge updates**
- **Resolve conflicts visually**
- **View Git history and stash changes**
- **Review pull requests directly in the IDE**

If you're interested in trying out WebStorm, you can download it from the link provided in the videoâ€™s description.

With Git installed and configured, you're now ready to start using version control effectively!
